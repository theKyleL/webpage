                <p>Welcome, I’m Kyle Latino, a new and curious software engineer. Here I will maintain a semi-journal of my projects and accomplishments. Aside from the posted info, the site itself is also an ongoing project of mine. </p>
                <p>I’ll attempt to limit the code to HTML5 and CSS for security as well as portability purposes, but we’ll see how it goes. <em>Feel free to poke around!</em>. </p>
