                <h3>Bitmap image data carving tool - 2017</h3>
                <p>This small Python program reads the bytes of a file to identify Bitmap image header data. When a bitmap header is located within the file, it’s data is copied and placed in a new .bmp file named according to its offset location in bytes. The resulting files can then be opened using any image viewer that supports the bitmap file format.
                <br>Check out the source code on my <a href=“https://github.com/theKyleL/stepic/blob/master/BMP_steg_scraper/bmp_steg_scrape.py”>github page</a>.</p>
                
                <h3>Senior design - Computer vision and object recognition - 2016-2017</h3>
                <p>For my team’s senior design project we developed a mobile camera system that could identify objects in the real world. The focus of the project was to identify traffic signs and pass an alert to the driver. The camera controller and object recognition system was written in C++ and utilized openCV libraries to handle the image processing. The User interface was written in Java to allow it to remain highly portable.</p>
                
                <h3>Custom 60-key mechanical keyboard - 2015</h3>
                <p>As a young software engineer my universe is full of things to tinker with and create. As most everything running on software requires code, and code requires language, I took it upon myself to build the base human interface device required to convert finger movement into characters. 
                The result was a mechanical keyboard comprised of CherryMX switches, PBT keycaps, and a Teensy 3.2 microcontroller. Once wired, assembled, and tested, it was mounted in a cherry wood case and remains my daily driver for intensive coding work or the occasional game.</p>
